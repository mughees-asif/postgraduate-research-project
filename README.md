## Abstract

In recent years, recommendation systems have been developed with graph neural networks (GNNs) to expedite the aggregation process of macro (e.g., topological structure) and micro (e.g., node information) operations to enrich information filtering capabilities. Additionally, using neural networks for recommendation tasks on graphlike data structures has been proven to elicit meaningful representations of user-item relationships. However, the representation learning process is not linear as social relations augmented with item interactions, both need to be considered for optimal results. This research project aims to address this issue by proposing a novel framework that is capable of using multiple preferences for outlining recommendations/ratings of specific items to users. The framework is also split into three variations that are pitted against published academic recommendation systems. The training and testing of the models is done by using two real-world datasets that contain user-item and user-user social media information.
